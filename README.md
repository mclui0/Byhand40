# Byhand40
Handwired 40% mechanical keyboard based on the [Pi Pico/Pro Micro], running [KMK] firmware. This will be my first project involving electronics and solder. 
The purpose of this build is to type notes on the go using my phone; therefore, the form factor and layout must be small for portability.
